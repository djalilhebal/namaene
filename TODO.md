# TODO

- [ ] UX: Selecting the voice using a hierarchical dropdown (lang > locale > voice).

- [ ] UX: Warning the user if a character is not supported in the selected language.  
AFAIK, this information is not available from the SDK itself, but both Google Cloud and Azure have pages that list supported phonemes, stress levels, etc.  
See `Ramblings.md`.

- [ ] Added cron job to ensure Vercel KV database is not deleted after 30 days on inactivity.

- [ ] Add dynamic OG image

    * https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-og-image-generation-fast-dynamic-social-card-images

    * Maybe use a Len-themed design. Orange and gray/black.
